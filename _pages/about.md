Welcome to my personal website! My name is Ziruo Xiao, and you can call me by any combination of Chloe, Ziruo, and Xiao.

I am a Master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, majoring in Information Networking (Advanced Study Track). My Master's study concentrates on computer systems, especially **Databases** and **Machine Learning Systems**. I am expected to graduate in 2026 Spring.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**, where I explored various fields in Computer Science. I did two software engineering internships at **Google** in database-related infrastructure teams (GPay Data Platform & Core Data, Indexing Engine). I also have experience in machine learning research (CV+Adversarial Learning, check out my bachelor's [Final Year Project](https://github.com/DL-for-CFD/alpinn_for_submission)). I participated in programming contests (OI & ICPC) in earlier years and have always enjoyed theoretical topics.
