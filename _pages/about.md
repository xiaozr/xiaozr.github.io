Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Ziruo Xiao. I am a Master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, majoring in Information Networking (Thesis Track). My Master's study concentrates on computer systems, especially **Databases** and **Machine Learning Systems**. I am expected to graduate in 2026 Spring.

I've had a strong interest in data infrastructure and actively sought practical experience. I did two software engineering internships at **Google** in database-related infrastructure teams (Indexing Engine, Core Data & GPay Data Platform), and this summer at **Confluent** where I helped deprecate some Ksql DB tables.

Through study into Computer Systems, I've recently gained more interest in ML Systems, specifically with distributed & parallel ideas, for which I am working on my Master's thesis, fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2/).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**, where I also explored various fields in Computer Science: I did a fun bachelor's [Final Year Project](https://github.com/DL-for-CFD/alpinn_for_submission) in CV+Adversarial Learning; I also participated in programming contests (OI & ICPC) and enjoys theoretical topics.
